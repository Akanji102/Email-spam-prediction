# Email-spam-prediction

ðŸ“© Spam Mail Prediction System

A Machine Learning project that classifies emails as Spam or Not Spam using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Scikit-learn.

ðŸš€ Overview

Over 45% of global emails are spam â€”a major cybersecurity and productivity issue.
This project builds a Spam Mail Prediction System that learns from email text data and predicts whether an incoming email is spam or legitimate.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

Python

Pandas, NumPy (data preprocessing)

Scikit-learn (ML models)

NLTK / re (text cleaning & NLP)

ðŸ“Š Project Workflow

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Removed stopwords, punctuation, and special characters

Tokenization & normalization of text

Feature Extraction

Used TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text into numerical features

Model Training

Logistic Regression (primary model)

Evaluated against Naive Bayes / SVM for comparison

Results

Achieved XX% accuracy on test data
